## BACKEND

    We use mongoose to connect to db 
    Express is used to make server 
    Express is then used to make API ROUTES(URL MAPPING)

## FRONT END
Index.html has a div , index.js load your app in that index.html div named as root

Then there's the app class which has a render function which is rendered in the root div

The app class is the whole JSX you need for complete MERN APP

But you might need componenets too? why components . You can instead of component write the JSX in app render function 

but it's not the best pracitce secondly

if you have to use a JSX again again it's best to make each UI as a component

Then on front end you might also need routing 

For routing see the other project of mern app

Sercvices:

Services are all the functions you might need to perform in your front 

in services there is also a services of REST API(AXIO) to connect your front end and back end

what's rest api?

(Server-> NODE JS)         <=========Rest API            <---REaCt APP
//we call it our backend                                    FRONT END

## How to make MERN APP 
## CLIENT SIDE
## make a class write all the logic in that class . The front End, Their JS Functions

## make a services folder to do the REST API WORK
